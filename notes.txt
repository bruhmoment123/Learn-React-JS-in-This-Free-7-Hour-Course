styled-components benefits:
scoped CSS
nest
no polyfills 
able to use props
const button = styled.button`` - tagged template literal

imports:
{} are for non-default imports

using index.js as file:
when importing a component from a folder, if named index.js, it will automatically imported.
For example:
import Component from './Component' is sufficient
however, if the original index.js was instead something like test.js,
you will need to import like this:
import Component from './Component/test.js'
however, a downside is that if you have large amounts of component folders with index.js, 
it will get confusing when opening multiple of them
